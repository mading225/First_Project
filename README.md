Data Cleaning: The missing values are cleaned by dropping missing values of relevant columns and filling in / imputing data in other rows.
               Irrelevant columns to the identified problem and objective were dropped for example 'Schedule'

Checking for Duplicates:The dataset is also checked for duplicated values and it was found that they exist.
                        The duplicated values were dropped because it is a process of data cleaning and it is also the best way to handle duplicated values in a dataset.

Makes with the highest Total Fatal Injuries: After the data cleaning process was done, the dataset was analyized to check for the aircraft make with the highest total number of fatal injuries.

Top 10 most used Aircraft Makes : The highest Aircraft Makes mostly used were also analylized in order to advise the company on which to buy based on the interest from other aircraft companies.
